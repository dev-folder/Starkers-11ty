# Starkers-11ty
A clean/basic blank portfolio site using 11ty

To make this website load with gitpages, you need to amend the file (line ..) and change '_site' to 'docs'. You also need to create a .nojekyll file

The site will have accessibility built within from scratch

The site will use decapcms as admin
